Dear [University Representative],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Mohamed Super Dumbuya, and Iâ€™m part of Tech Inspire SL, an organization dedicated to inspiring and educating students in Sierra Leone about technology and its career opportunities. 

We are currently building a section on our platform that will provide students with accurate and helpful information about local university programs, particularly in the tech field.

We would love to partner with [University Name] to offer students the latest information about your tech-related courses and admissions. By doing so, we believe we can guide more students toward successful careers in technology, benefiting both the students and your institution.

Could we schedule a meeting to discuss how we can collaborate?

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
Mohamed Super Dumbuya  
Co-Founder, Tech Inspire SL
